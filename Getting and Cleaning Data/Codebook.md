This document will provide a brief description of the "UCI HAR Dataset" and describe the 
transformation of the desired portions of this study into a tidy dataset. This transformation
was done in accordance of the parameters of the Peer Assessment of "Getting and Cleaning Data".

The raw dataset consists of 30 subjects which have been seperated into training and test sets.
The training set consists of 21 subjects (70%) and the test set consists of 9 subjects (30%). The
data from both the training and test sets is organized in an fashion.

The script "run_analysis.R" uses the following files from the UCI HAR Dataset:
  - activity_labels.txt
  - features.txt
  - subject_train.txt
  - X_train.txt
  - y_train.txt
  - subject_test.txt
  - X_test.txt
  - y_test.txt
  
The data from these files is transformed using "run_analysis.R" and turned into 
"Tidy_Dataset_of_UCI_HAR_Data.txt".

The tidy dataset contains 68 columns and 180 rows (181 including header). Each row represents a
uniquecombination of the 6 activites from "activity_labels.txt" for each of the 30 subjects in the
study. The activity and subject number are described in the first two columns. The remaining 66
columns consist of the mean of selected measurements taken during the course of the study.

##Excerpt from UCI HAR features_info.txt describing the variables
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals 
tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a
constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass
Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration
signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and 
tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk 
signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional 
signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag,
tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, 
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to 
indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
